The Research Meeting and School on Distributed Computing by Mobile
Robots (MAC) will take place October 12-13, 2025, in Kathmandu, Nepal co-located with 
  <a href="https://sss2025.conf.lip6.fr/" target="_blank">SSS 2025</a>.
<br><br>
Distributed robot computing is the study of complexity and
computability in systems where the computational entities themselves
are capable of movement within the spatial universe they inhabit. The
field has applications in areas as diverse as autonomous robots moving
in a terrain, software agents moving in a network, autonomous
intelligent vehicles, wireless mobile ad-hoc networks, and networks of
mobile sensors.
<br><br>
The goal of the research meeting, the 10th in the MAC series, is to bring together researchers
working in this areas in order to exchange problems, ideas, techniques,
and results. The objective is to create a clearer picture of the state
of the art in the field, to identify outstanding open problems and
research directions, and to foster collaborative investigation of
selected problems.
<br><br>
The event includes participation by graduate students and post-doctoral
fellows.
<br><br>
There will be invited talks on current research topics and presentations of open problems. The discussion and study of these open problems constitutes an integral part of the event.
